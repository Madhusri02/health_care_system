Healthcare Information Management System (HIMS) is an application created as a DBMS project for one of our institute's courses on database management systems. 
The HIMS application can be used by hospitals, clinics and healthcare centres to manage data/records for patients, doctors, prescriptions, medical tests and various departments within the healthcare facility.
Besides the basic DBMS functionalities such as addition, deletion, and other useful features are also present in this application.
